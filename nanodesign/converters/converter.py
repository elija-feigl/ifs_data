""" This module is used to convert DNA design files into other file formats.

    An input caDNAno design file is conveted into a DnaStructure object
    containing information about the design (e.g. lattice type, virtual helix
    definitions) and information derived from that design (e.g. strands,
    domains). caDNAno design files may contain deleted/inserted bases. By
    default the DnaStructure is not created with deleted/inserted bases. The
    DnaStructure is created with deleted/inserted bases by specifying the
    --modify command-line argument.
